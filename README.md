Presenting Breeze - The Morning Alarm App


<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ninestarstudios.breeze&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png'/></a>

The purpose of this app was to get me some experience with developing something useful. It's now being repurposed so that new Android developers can learn from it, experienced developers can contribute to it and non-developers can install and request features for it.

Right now, the app can:

1. Set one alarm at a time. This was intentional and is unlikely to change.
2. Choose from four tunes:
    * Downpour
    * Knocker-Up
    * Cock
    * Singing Bowl
3. Toggle between increasing and steady alarm sound (experimental).
4. Toggle alarm vibrations.
5. Choose between four backgrounds:

Known bugs include:
1. The increasing alarm sound feature might not work.
2. The alarm starts ringing after being cancelled and keeps on doing so until the app is cleared from the memory.

Planned features:
1. Alarm notifications.
2. Making the UI usable, then pleasant.
3. Commenting the code for newcomers. 
4. 24-hour format support.
5. Language localization.
6. Alarm currently uses music volume instead of alarm volume. Fix that.

Features that might be done, please give feedback:
1. Automatically sending messages to your friends and family when you wake up.
2. Playing music from a playlist created by the user when the alarm is turned off.
3. Bedtime stories.

Feel free to fix bugs, use the app for your own purposes, work on new features or suggest improvements!
